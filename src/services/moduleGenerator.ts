  // Page 1: Introduction & The Strategic Foundation
  pages.push({
    title: "1. The Strategic Foundation",
    content: `Welcome to your professional journey in **${title}**. In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, simply knowing "how" to code or use a tool is no longer enough. To become a high-value expert, you must understand the **First Principles** that govern this domain.

### Why ${title} Matters Now
The modern economy rewards those who can bridge the gap between abstract concepts and production-ready solutions. By mastering **${title}**, you aren't just learning a skill; you're acquiring a strategic asset that allows you to:
- **Solve Complex Problems**: Move beyond "Stack Overflow" solutions to deep, architectural thinking.
- **Drive Innovation**: Understand the constraints and possibilities of the technology to push boundaries.
- **Future-Proof Your Career**: Tools change, but the underlying logic of **${title}** remains constant.

> **Visual: The Skill Hierarchy Graph**
> [ Fundamental Logic ] --> [ Architectural Patterns ] --> [ Frameworks/Tools ]
> *Mastering the base (Logic) makes the top (Tools) easy to swap.*

### The Abilities AI Approach
We don't just teach you syntax. We build your **Architectural Intuition**. Our curriculum is built on three pillars:
1. **First Principles Thinking**: We explain the *why* so you can adapt to any *how*.
2. **Production-Ready Patterns**: Every concept is paired with a pattern used by elite engineering teams at companies like Vercel and Stripe.
3. **Future-Proofing**: We focus on the standards that will remain relevant even as AI takes over the "boilerplate" of coding.

### 🧠 Knowledge Check
- Why is ${title} more critical now than 5 years ago?
- What is the "First Principles" approach?

**Let's begin by looking at the core architecture that powers professional-grade systems.**`
  });

  // Page 2: Core Architecture & Mental Models
  pages.push({
    title: "2. Architectural Mental Models",
    content: `Mastery starts with how you visualize the system. For **${title}**, we use specific mental models to ensure our designs are robust and scalable.

### The "Onion" Architecture
Think of your system in layers. At the very center is your **Domain Logic**—the pure, unadulterated rules of your business.
- **Inner Core**: Pure logic, no dependencies. This is the most stable part of your app.
- **Application Layer**: Orchestrates the flow of data.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: The "outer shell" where databases, APIs, and UIs live.

> **Graph: Onion Architecture Layers**
> ( ( ( Domain Logic ) Application Services ) Infrastructure/UI )
> *Arrows always point inward. The core never knows about the outside world.*

### Why This Matters
By decoupling your core logic from the "outer shell," you make your system **testable** and **evolvable**. If you need to switch from a SQL database to a NoSQL one, your core logic remains untouched.

### Essential Design Patterns in ${title}
- **The Strategy Pattern**: Allowing algorithms to be selected at runtime. This is crucial for systems that need to support multiple providers or configurations.
- **The Facade Pattern**: Providing a simplified interface to a complex body of code. Essential for maintaining clean boundaries.
- **The Proxy Pattern**: Adding a layer of control over object access, useful for logging, caching, and validation.

### 🧠 Expert Tip
Always ask: *"If I removed my framework today, how much of my business logic would survive?"* The higher that number, the better your architecture.`
  });

  // Page 3: Implementation Excellence
  pages.push({
    title: "3. Implementation Excellence",
    content: `Now, let's look at how we translate these architectural models into high-quality code. In **${title}**, "working code" is the bare minimum. We aim for **Excellence**.

### The Three Pillars of Clean Implementation
1. **Type Safety**: Use the compiler as your first line of defense. In professional **${title}** projects, we avoid \`any\` and embrace strict typing to catch errors before they ever reach production.
2. **Predictability**: Functions should be pure whenever possible. Given the same input, they should always return the same output without side effects.
3. **Self-Documenting Code**: Your code should tell a story. Use descriptive naming and clear structures so that a developer reading your code six months from now understands exactly what's happening.

### Real-World Example
Instead of a generic \`handleData(x)\`, use \`processUserOnboarding(userData)\`. It's a small change that drastically improves maintainability.

### 🧠 Knowledge Check
- Why is "Type Safety" critical for production systems?
- What makes code "Self-Documenting"?

**Next, we'll explore the advanced patterns that allow these systems to handle complex, real-world requirements.**`
  });

  // Page 4: Advanced Patterns for Masters
  pages.push({
    title: "4. Advanced Patterns for Masters",
    content: `As you move towards expert status in **${title}**, you'll encounter problems that simple logic can't solve. This is where **Design Patterns** come in.

### The Strategy Pattern in Action
Imagine you have multiple ways to process a request (e.g., different payment methods). Instead of a giant \`if/else\` block, use the **Strategy Pattern**.

**Example Implementation:**
\`\`\`typescript
interface PaymentStrategy {
  process(amount: number): void;
}

class StripeStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
  process(amount: number) { /* Stripe logic */ }
}

class PayPalStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
  process(amount: number) { /* PayPal logic */ }
}
\`\`\`

### The Result Object Pattern
Stop throwing errors for expected failures. Instead, return a **Result Object** that explicitly contains either a \`Success\` value or a \`Failure\` reason.
\`\`\`typescript
type Result<T> = 
  | { success: true; data: T } 
  | { success: false; error: string };
\`\`\`
This forces you to handle the error case, leading to much more resilient systems.

> **Visual: Error Flow Comparison**
> Traditional: [ Code ] --(Exception)--> [ Crash/Catch ]
> Result Pattern: [ Code ] --(Object)--> [ Explicit Handling ]

### 🧠 Knowledge Check
- How does the Strategy Pattern improve code maintainability?
- Why is returning a Result object safer than throwing an exception?`
  });

  // Page 5: Production-Grade Hardening
  pages.push({
    title: "5. Production-Grade Hardening",
    content: `A system that works but is slow or insecure is a liability. In this section, we harden our **${title}** implementation for the real world.

### Performance: The "Golden Signals"
Monitor these four signals to understand your system's health:
1. **Latency**: The time it takes to service a request.
2. **Traffic**: The demand placed on your system.
3. **Errors**: The rate of requests that fail.
4. **Saturation**: How "full" your service is (e.g., CPU or memory usage).

### Security: Defensive Programming
- **Input Validation**: Never trust user input. Sanitize and validate everything at the boundary.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Every component should only have the permissions it absolutely needs to function.
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regularly check your third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities.

> **Visual: Security Layers**
> [ Firewall ] -> [ Load Balancer ] -> [ Auth Layer ] -> [ App Logic ] -> [ Database ]
> *Each layer is a point of defense.*

**Security isn't a feature; it's a foundation.**`
  });

  // Page 6: The Path to Production
  pages.push({
    title: "6. The Path to Production",
    content: `The final step in mastering **${title}** is understanding how to get your code into the hands of users safely and reliably.

### The Testing Pyramid
- **Unit Tests (Base)**: Test individual functions in isolation. Fast and numerous.
- **Integration Tests (Middle)**: Test how components work together.
- **E2E Tests (Top)**: Test the entire user journey. Slow but critical for confidence.

> **Graph: Testing Pyramid**
>       / E2E \\      <-- Fewest
>      /  Int  \\
>     /   Unit  \\    <-- Most
>    -----------

### CI/CD: Automated Excellence
In a professional environment, we use **Continuous Integration and Deployment**. Every change is automatically:
1. Linted for style.
2. Type-checked for safety.
3. Tested for correctness.
4. Deployed to a staging environment for final review.

### Scaling for Millions
When your **${title}** system needs to grow, we look at **Horizontal Scaling**—adding more instances of your app rather than just a bigger server. This requires your app to be **stateless**, meaning it doesn't store user data in memory between requests.

### 🧠 Knowledge Check
- What is the difference between a Unit test and an Integration test?
- Why is Horizontal Scaling preferred for modern systems?`
  });

  // Page 7: Real-World Case Studies
  pages.push({
    title: "7. Real-World Case Studies",
    content: `Theory meets reality. In this section, we look at how **${title}** scales when faced with millions of users and global distribution.

### Lessons from the Tech Giants
- **Netflix**: "Design for failure." Assume every service, network link, and database will fail at some point. Build your system to survive these failures gracefully using patterns like circuit breakers and fallbacks.
- **Amazon**: "You build it, you run it." Developers are responsible for the operational health, performance, and security of their code in production, leading to better architectural decisions.

### Case Study: The "Thundering Herd" Problem
Imagine a million users hitting your **${title}** service at the exact same second. Without proper **Rate Limiting** and **Caching**, your system will collapse.
- **Solution**: Implement Exponential Backoff and Jitter on the client side, and robust caching on the server side.

### 🧠 Knowledge Check
- Explain the concept of "Design for Failure".
- How do "Circuit Breakers" protect your application?`

  // Page 8: Conclusion & Career Mastery
  pages.push({
    title: "8. Conclusion & Career Mastery",
    content: `Congratulations! You have completed the professional curriculum for **${title}**. You have moved from basic understanding to a deep, architectural, and operational perspective.

### Summary of Your New Skills
- **Architectural Vision**: You can now see the "big picture" and design systems that are built to last, scale, and evolve.
- **Implementation Excellence**: You write clean, type-safe, testable, and high-performance code using industry-standard patterns.
- **Operational Mastery**: You understand how to deploy, monitor, secure, and scale your work in a professional production environment.

### The Path Forward
